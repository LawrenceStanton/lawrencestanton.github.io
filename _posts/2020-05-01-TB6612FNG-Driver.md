# Easy Motor Control

The TB6612FNG is a dual DC motor driver IC with a H-Bridge topology. The driver is most suited for small 6V DC motors. Since its invention and with the introduction of breakout boards from several manufacturers, this IC has become popular for small robotic devices. The TB6612FNG driver was made to simplify the operation of the IC by a microcontroller, and has been made available open source to help new projects get up to speed.
