I am an Undergraduate Mechatronics Engineering student at the University of Cape Town. Mechatronics is a broad subject, and my focus lies in Embedded Systems and Circuit Design. Prior to Mechatronics I studied 2 years of Chemical Engineering and left the degree in good standing and having completed a minor in Chemistry. My secondary education was at St John's College, Johannesburg. I plan to pursue a Masters in Electrical Engineering in 2021 in the field of advanced PCB Circuit design.

My transfer from Chemical Engineering was largely due to my interests in automation and systems design, hence my speciality. I design and program embedded hardware — including PCB  Design, Power Electronics, Sensing and Microcontroller Programming. My peripheral skills encompass Control Engineering, general programming, Mathematics, Mechanics, Physics and Chemistry. Thus far my work experience has largely been the design and testing of scientific measurement and communications equipment.

I do volunteer work for SCOUTS South Africa. Having been fully involved in my youth, I later volunteered as an adult leader at a local group in Rondebosch after moving to Cape Town and  helped found the group's first Rover Crew for young adults. In 2019 I was appointed to the [Scout Management Committee](https://www.scouts.org.za/manco/), the national management team of the organisation. My work has been to draft organisational policy, establish and recruit a national team of youth, and to reinstate the [National Youth Forum](https://www.scouts.org.za/2020/04/16/national-youth-forum-back/) — amongst other endeavours.
